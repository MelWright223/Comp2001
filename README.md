This repository is split into two projects, the first project being creating a RESTful API based on the scenario given, and the second being a PHP application that displays a dataset in human readable and machine readable. 

The API project insisted of making tables and stored procedures in SQL server, these would then be used in the API where data can be inputted and used with the stored procedures. However, not all the SQL that I have created will be exposed by the API, for example the trigger that puts a new password in when the user changes their password, or the view that logs how many times a certain user has created a new session. 

Finally, with the PHP project I have used a template from W3 which I will link below, which helps display my chosen dataset in a human readable format. However on a separate page I have tried to write the dataset in machine language, using rdf triples.
